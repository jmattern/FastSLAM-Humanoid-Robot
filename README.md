# FastSLAM-Humanoid-Robot
Implementation of FastSLAM for a Humanoid robot.  The datasets used for testing this was a few runs from an earlier iteration of the THOR humanoid robot provided by University of Pennsylvania.  This repository does not have the datasets used to get the displayed results, but it contains the input format for achieving like results with similar robots.
